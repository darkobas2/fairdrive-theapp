# Fairdrive

At the intersection of innovation, interoperability, and decentralization, Fairdrive emerges for the cause of fair data. This initiative, driven by the community, is dedicated to promoting freedom. By facilitating decentralized storage, it allows developers to construct interoperable, decentralized, and open-source dApps. This, in turn, enables users to regain their privacy, assume ownership of their data, and control their digital identity.

### What is Fairdrive

Fairdrive is a decentralized application (dApp) that facilitates distributed storage on the Swarm network. It features a "Drive" interface for managing pods, files and folders. Internally, Fairdrive uses Fair Data Protocol, which is built on top of Ethereum Swarm. 

### Why Fairdrive
#### Pros
- **Data Encryption**: Fairdrive encrypts all data by default, providing an additional layer of security for your files.
- **Data Ownership**: Unlike traditional cloud storage services, where your data is technically owned by the service provider, with Fairdrive, you are the sole owner of your data.
- **Decentralized Storage**: Fairdrive stores data on the Swarm decentralized network. This means your data isn't stored in a single location, but is distributed across multiple nodes, enhancing data security and reliability.
- **User Control**: Only you have access to your data. You control who can access your data and how it's used.

#### Cons
- **Speed**: Due to its decentralized nature, Fairdrive can be slower than traditional cloud storage services. This is because data isn't stored in a single location, but is distributed across multiple nodes in the Swarm network. As a result, it can take longer to retrieve data.
- **Learning Curve**: As a decentralized application (dApp), Fairdrive might have a steeper learning curve for users who are not familiar with blockchain technology and decentralized networks.
- **Dependence on Swarm Network**: The performance and reliability of Fairdrive are dependent on the Swarm network. If there are issues with the network, it could affect the availability and performance of Fairdrive.
- **Data Recovery**: In case of loss of access keys, data recovery might be challenging or impossible due to the decentralized and encrypted nature of the storage.

## Development Stage Notice for Fairdrive
Please be aware that Fairdrive is currently in its development stage. This means that the application is still undergoing substantial updates, modifications, and improvements. As a result, certain functionalities may change, be added, or removed without prior notice.

During this development stage, there's also a risk of data loss. While we strive to ensure the integrity and security of all data stored on Fairdrive, the decentralized nature of the application and the ongoing development work mean that we cannot guarantee complete data preservation.

Furthermore, please note that the maintainers of Fairdrive do not assume responsibility for any data loss, changes in functionality, or any other issues that may arise while using the application during its development stage.

We strongly recommend that you keep backups of any critical data you store on Fairdrive and use the application with an understanding of these risks during its development stage. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we continue to improve and refine Fairdrive.
